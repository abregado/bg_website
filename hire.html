        <p>So you have a great game idea, but you are worried about the risk of funding its development.</p>
        <p><strong>Binary Gambit</strong> can help!</p>

        <h2>Benifits of Rapid Prototyping?</h2>
        <p>Having a game developed can cost 100’s of thousands of dollars, and there is no guarantee that a concept will actually take off. <stong>Professionals</stong> in the games industry use a technique known as <strong>Rapid Prototyping</strong> to mitigate these risks.</p>
        <p>Rapid Prototypes are not full <strong>saleable products</strong>. They are <strong>playable</strong>, but only enough to prove or disprove the worth of a design. These can take as little as 2 days to build, which means you <strong>save money</strong> while finding out if you want to invest in a full scale production.</p>
        <p>If you decide you want to fund your game in full, having a Prototype to show a production house will save you a lot of time when you try to explain your idea. It also makes it much <strong>faster to develop</strong> a full product, which means you save even more money.</p>
        <p>so, why risk funding the full development of your concept before you know if it will be fun? </p>
        <p>Binary Gambit <strong>specialises</strong> in creating rapid prototypes and would be very happy to give you a quote.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Will my idea still be mine legally?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, your idea will stay your idea, whether we develop a prototype or not. If we develop a prototype for you, it is yours to do with as you please.</dd>
            <dt>If I want to take development further, must I hire Binary Gambit?</dt>
            <dd>No! You can take your prototype to any games studio to have it developed. We are also happy to recommend some studios.</dd>
            <dt>What will my prototype look like?</dt>
            <dd>We have a few prototypes available to play on our website. Generally prototypes dont have detailed User Interfaces, fancy graphics and tend to be “ugly”. They will perform their main function: To prove your game idea rocks!</dd>
            <dt>How specific can I be with my concept? </dt>
            <dd>As specific as you like! However, we will only include the minimum amount of elements to prove your concept is worthwhile.</dd>
            <dt>Can you help me polish my concept?</dt>
            <dd>Yes, we can provide feedback for your concept and suggest changes to make it more fun.</dd>
